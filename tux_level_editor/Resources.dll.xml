            <summary>
            The ResourceManager is responsible for querying and loading of
            application resources
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Resources can be plain files on disk, but could
            also be stored in compressed archives or dynamically loaded from the net,
            that's why we use a ResourceManager here.
