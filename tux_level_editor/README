This is an unstable release of the TuxJunior Milestone 2 editor, it is a copy of the Supertux Milestone 2 editor.
Do not expect everything to work smoothly and save often...

All Credit for this work goes out to the Supertux Dev Team. Thanks!

== Prerequisites ==

 * TuxJunior 
 * OpenGL driver and environment
 * mono 1.2.2.1 or newer
   (1.1.13 or newer may work but if it doesn't, don't blame us just
    upgrade to 1.2.2.1 or newer)
 * gtk-sharp 2.8 or newer


== Building ==

Type
	make


== Running ==

You can start the editor by typing
	mono tuxjunior-editor.exe

If you receive errors when starting, try this flag:
mono --runtime=v4.0 tuxjunior-editor.exe


To run with debugging info (that is the only way to get a usable
backtrace for a bug report in case of a crash):
	mono --debug tuxjunior-editor.exe

Remember to set your TuxJunior paths in the editor options!


== Known Problems ==

The open source ATI drivers seem to have problems with multiple viewports
and shared textures.
